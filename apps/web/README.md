# Cresco web (`apps/web`)

Consumer frontend for Cresco, the family-facing experience on top of the KEYS bounded-autonomy backend in this repository.

> Learn in context. Act freely inside bounds. Ask for more freedom only at the boundary.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run check      # typecheck + lint + test + build
```

Production uses the hosted KEYS v0.2 Cloudflare API by default. For local development you can point the frontend at a local API:

```bash
(cd ../.. && npm install && npm run api)                          # 127.0.0.1:8787
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYS_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787" > .env.local
```

### Execute integration (local simulated test server)

```bash
npm run mock:keys                                   # mock KEYS API on 127.0.0.1:8788
MOCK_EXECUTE_SCENARIO=pending-once npm run mock:keys # or: slow | error500-once | malformed
printf "NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYS_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8788\nNEXT_PUBLIC_KEYS_EXECUTION=runtime\n" >> .env.local
```

Mock proofs are `simulated: true` with `MOCK…` signatures and are labeled "Test run (simulated)" in the UI. The public contract is `docs/FRONTEND-BACKEND-CONTRACT-V0.2.md`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/app` | Routes (child app in `(child)`, parent area in `parent/(dash)`, full-screen flows `lesson`, `invest`, `onboarding`, `start`) |
| `src/components` | Design-system components and SVG illustrations |
| `src/domain` | Types (KEYS contract vocabulary), policy preview, formatting |
| `src/services` | Service interfaces + hosted KEYS v0.2 HTTP adapter |
| `src/mocks` | Practice/sample data only; live evidence overlays are explicitly tagged |
| `src/state` | UI cache + local preferences; Family authority/state re-syncs from Cloudflare |

## Truth labels

Prices are samples unless tagged **Live · Pyth**. The current AAPL Money lane executes a **demo SPL token on Solana Devnet** through the KEYS program with Pyth evidence. Test funding is backend demo credit only. Cresco does not claim bank/card funding, brokerage, custody, real AAPL ownership, mainnet or real minor securities execution.

Live demo: https://cresco-lac.vercel.app (standalone Vercel project `cresco`, deployed from `apps/web`; separate from the KEYS backend project).

Deploy as its own Vercel project with root directory `apps/web`. `next build` typechecks app code via `tsconfig.build.json`; tests (including the backend parity test, which needs the full repo) are typechecked by `npm run typecheck`.
