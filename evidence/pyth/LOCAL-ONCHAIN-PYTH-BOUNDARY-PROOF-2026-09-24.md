# CRESCO — Local On-Chain Pyth Bounded-Autonomy Proof

Date: 2026-09-24  
Network: local Solana validator with cloned canonical Pyth Lazer verifier/state  
Workflow: `solana-authority-proof`  
Run: https://github.com/Faadil1/cresco/actions/runs/35956618933  
Result: **PASS — 12 passing**

## What this proof establishes

CRESCO now verifies authenticated Pyth Pro/Lazer market evidence **inside the Solana capital-execution path** on a local validator.

The transaction contains:

1. a Pyth-signed Solana-format TSLA market message;
2. a preceding Ed25519 verification instruction;
3. the CRESCO `execute_within_mandate_with_pyth` instruction carrying the exact signed message bytes;
4. a CPI from CRESCO into the canonical Pyth Lazer verifier;
5. CRESCO parsing the already-verified payload and applying Mandate policy before capital can move.

The proof shows all three required market-evidence roles:

- **Execution truth:** one unit of the demo asset executes under a Pyth-derived USD notional boundary.
- **Notional refusal:** two units are refused with `PythNotionalExceeded`.
- **Precommitted condition refusal:** a price ceiling below the verified live price refuses with `MarketConditionInvalidated`.

Pyth has **no authority effect**. The market condition can restrict/refuse an action; it cannot widen Maya's Mandate.

## Architecture detail

The CRESCO SBF program intentionally does **not** embed the full Pyth off-chain protocol SDK.

Instead:

- cryptographic signer verification is delegated to the canonical Pyth Lazer Solana program;
- CRESCO carries a small parser for only the signed properties it explicitly requests:
  - price;
  - exponent;
  - confidence;
  - publisher count;
  - market session;
  - feed update timestamp;
- freshness and confidence are then checked against the active Mandate;
- price is converted to micro-USD for deterministic integer notional checks.

This keeps the verifier load-bearing without unnecessarily inflating the CRESCO program binary.

## Truth boundary

This is a **real local Solana proof** with live authenticated Pyth TSLA evidence and a demo/mock SPL token.

It does not prove:

- real tokenized-stock execution;
- brokerage/custody;
- legal minor securities ownership;
- Solana mainnet deployment.

Canonical devnet confirmation remains a separate gate until its runtime proof passes.
