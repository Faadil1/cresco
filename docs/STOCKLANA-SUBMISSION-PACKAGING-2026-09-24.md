# Stocklana — KEYS Submission Packaging

Date: 2026-09-24  
Status: **ALL CURRENT TECHNICAL GATES PASS — READY FOR JUDGE RECORDING + FINAL PACKAGING**

## Submission target

Main submission: **KEYS Family**

Sponsor tracks:
- **Pyth**
- **Tessera**

PreStocks remains technically integrated as a representation/Practice surface but is **not selected as a bounty** while Tessera is present, because the official PreStocks bounty excludes projects integrating any non-PreStocks pre-IPO token.

Do not add Clawpump or Meteora unless their activation gates change before submission.

Official platform submission surfaces support:
- GitHub repository;
- live demo deployed to devnet or mainnet;
- pitch video up to 3 minutes;
- technical video up to 5 minutes;
- sponsor-track selection.

Our submission should use all four supporting surfaces even where optional.

## One-line product

**KEYS lets a young person act independently with capital inside family-set limits, while Solana enforces the boundary and Pyth supplies market truth.**

Alternative consumer line:

**Financial independence shouldn’t happen all at once. KEYS gives young people a key: freedom inside clear limits, a request only when they reach the boundary.**

## Problem

Youth finance products commonly turn the parent-child relationship into either:
- continuous per-action permission; or
- a jump from supervised learning to broad account access.

That leaves little room for **bounded independence**: real decision-making without either constant approval or unrestricted authority.

## Solution

A guardian creates a versioned **Mandate**:
- allowed action;
- asset scope;
- per-action limit;
- period limit;
- market conditions;
- status / revocation;
- version + nonce.

Inside the Mandate, the child acts without requesting permission.

Outside it, KEYS refuses and may offer a short boundary request.

Only an authorized guardian can:
- allow once;
- widen standing authority;
- refuse.

Learning and market evidence can inform or restrict. Neither can grant authority.

## Why Solana is necessary

The core promise is stronger than a parental-control UI.

The capital boundary is enforced by the KEYS Solana program:
- in-bounds execution;
- out-of-bounds refusal;
- versioned authority;
- stale-nonce refusal;
- pause/downward authority;
- guardian-authored policy changes.

This makes the receipt independently inspectable rather than asking judges to trust browser state.

## Final technical proof closure

All current hackathon technical gates are closed.

- Node/API CI: **PASS**.

There is no remaining implementation gate before judge recording. Production auth/KYC, embedded wallets, fiat rails, regulated brokerage/custody, mainnet and all-symbol live history remain intentionally outside the hackathon truth boundary.

## Why Pyth is necessary

Pyth provides external market truth used in the capital path.

For the current AAPL lane, KEYS verifies live signed Pyth evidence through the on-chain Pyth Lazer path and uses it for:
- price/notional computation;
- freshness/confidence checks;
- notional boundaries;
- precommitted market conditions.

Rule:

> **Pyth can stop an action. Pyth cannot give the child more authority.**

Current proof feed:

`Equity.US.AAPL/USD` — feed id `922`.

**AAPL is our primary execution proof, not our market universe.**

The same Pyth integration now powers an entitlement-checked Learn/Practice discovery layer across verified equities, crypto, FX, metals and commodities. Only AAPL is presented as the current proven Money execution lane.

## PreStocks sponsor integration

PreStocks extends the learning/representation layer, not the hero flow.

KEYS consumes the official public PreStocks catalog and exposes:
- exact Solana representation;
- representation semantics;
- live public market/mark context when available;
- eligibility state.

Default:
- eligibility = UNKNOWN;
- execution eligible = false;
- Practice = available;
- authority effect = NONE.

Do not imply direct private-company equity ownership or live minor execution.


## Tessera sponsor integration

Tessera strengthens KEYS' representation-learning layer with live private-market T-Token metadata.

Current live routes:
- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/tessera`
- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/tessera/:asset`

Canonical proof:
- live API proof: `36112072978` — **PASS**
- hosted Cloudflare proof: `36112229684` — **PASS**
- Cresco Web / WebKit: `36112502712` / `36112502709` — **PASS**

Judge framing:

> “A token ticker is not the same thing as owning company shares. Tessera lets KEYS show that distinction with real private-market representations: these T-Tokens are loan participation rights. Eligibility and KEYS authority remain separate, and we keep them in Learn/Practice unless explicitly proven executable.”

Tessera does **not** widen a Mandate, does not create Money eligibility, and is not claimed as real minor securities execution.

## 3-minute pitch video

### 0:00–0:15 — product immediately

Show **My Key** on screen.

Voice:

> “Financial independence shouldn’t happen all at once. KEYS gives a young person freedom to make capital decisions inside limits their family understands — without asking permission every time.”

### 0:15–0:40 — in-bounds autonomy

Show a small AAPL Money action within the current limit.

Expected:
- ALLOW;
- no guardian approval screen;
- confirmed Devnet receipt.

Voice:

> “Inside the Key, Alex acts independently. This is not a frontend permission check: the bounded action goes through our KEYS program on Solana Devnet.”

Briefly expose receipt:
- Devnet;
- program id;
- transaction signature;
- current Mandate nonce/version;
- Pyth verification.

### 0:40–1:05 — boundary

Attempt the larger action.

Expected:
- refuse;
- plain-language boundary;
- Ask for more room.

Voice:

> “Outside the standing boundary, the action does not execute. Alex can change the amount, practice, or ask for more room.”

### 1:05–1:30 — human authority

Send the request. Switch to guardian.

Show:
- exact request;
- current vs requested amount;
- Allow once / Widen / Refuse.

Choose **Allow once**.

Voice:

> “Sam can approve exactly this one boundary crossing without permanently widening Alex’s standing authority.”

### 1:30–1:50 — exact one-time action succeeds

Switch back into the child session and retry the same $20 action.

Expected:
- confirmed Devnet execution;
- exact request/amount/nonce binding;
- allowance becomes consumed.

Voice:

> “The exact action is now allowed once. The permission is specific, nonce-bound and consumed by the successful execution.”

### 1:50–2:05 — negative path: replay refuses

Attempt to reuse the same one-time permission.

Expected:
- **REFUSE**;
- `AllowanceAlreadyUsed`;
- no second execution.

Voice:

> “Real failure is part of the proof. Reusing the same permission is refused on-chain: one-time means one-time.”

### 2:05–2:25 — Pyth

Show market evidence.

Voice:

> “Pyth is load-bearing market truth: it prices the action and can invalidate a market condition. It can restrict authority, never create it.”

### 2:25–2:40 — learning

Show a contextual Learn/Practice beat, including the broader live Pyth market discovery surface.

Voice:

> “Because the user is young, learning is part of the product. They can explore how stocks, crypto, currencies, metals and commodities behave using live Pyth data — but learning or market access never silently unlocks Money authority.”

### 2:40–2:52 — Tessera / representation truth

Brief Tessera representation detail / Practice surface.

Voice:

> “Tessera lets us teach the difference between a company, a tokenized private-market representation, eligibility and family authority without pretending those are the same thing.”

### 2:52–3:00 — close

Return to My Key.

Voice:

> “KEYS turns family supervision into bounded autonomy: learn in context, act freely inside bounds, ask for more freedom only at the boundary.”

## 5-minute technical walkthrough

### 0:00–0:45 — architecture

Show:

```text
Cresco
  → Cloudflare Worker
  → Durable Family State
  → KEYS policy/runtime
  → Pyth
  → Solana Devnet program
```

Explain browser state is a cache, not authority.

### 0:45–1:35 — Solana program

Show:
- Mandate;
- AssetRule;
- program-controlled vault;
- version/nonce;
- `execute_within_mandate_with_pyth`.

Explain:
- guardian-only transition;
- child execution inside bounds;
- stale nonce.

### 1:35–2:20 — Pyth path

Show:
- server fetches signed Pyth Pro payload;
- Ed25519 verification instruction;
- Pyth Lazer verification;
- USD/notional enforcement;
- market condition.

Explicitly say Pyth authority effect is NONE.

Show Durable Object:
- Family state;
- reservation;
- idempotency;
- balance/period serialization;
- hosted multi-asset concurrency proof;
- finalize confirmed execution.

Explain why concurrent requests cannot independently overspend the same family period boundary. The hosted proof uses AAPL/TSLA-labeled reservations against one shared budget, but does not claim TSLA Money execution.

## Submission description

### Short

**Cresco / KEYS is a consumer authority layer for programmable capital. A guardian defines a standing Key; a young person acts independently inside it, asks only at the boundary, and can receive a one-time exception without permanently widening the Key. Solana enforces the demo-capital boundary in the execution path, Pyth provides load-bearing market truth, and only the guardian can increase standing authority. The Stocklana demo uses a Devnet demo token and does not claim brokerage, custody or real minor securities execution.**

### Longer

**KEYS asks a different question from traditional youth investing apps: what if the parent did not have to approve every decision, but the child still could not exceed an understandable standing boundary?**

A guardian authors a versioned Mandate describing what actions are allowed, the asset scope, per-action and period limits, market conditions and status. Inside that Mandate, the child acts independently. Outside it, the Solana program refuses and the product can offer a family-private request for more room.

Pyth supplies live market evidence to the execution path. It can make an action invalid or too large, but it can never expand human authority. Guardian widening is explicit, versioned and nonce-protected; old authorization becomes stale.

The demo uses Solana Devnet, a demo SPL token, a server-held Devnet demo signer and the current AAPL Pyth proof lane. Cloudflare Durable Objects hold synchronized Family demo state and serialize reservations/idempotency across devices. Contextual learning remains first-class: core investing claims show primary/official sources and a verification date, then route into Explore/Practice application. Learning/XP/P&L never automatically changes limits.

Tessera is the selected pre-IPO sponsor surface. PreStocks remains integrated as a secondary representation/Practice layer with eligibility fail-closed by default, but is not entered as a bounty while Tessera remains in the submitted build.

## Judge Q&A

### “Is this real money?”

No. The hackathon capital lane uses a **demo SPL token on Solana Devnet**. The transaction and KEYS/Pyth enforcement are real Devnet execution; the asset is explicitly test/demo capital. We do not claim brokerage, custody or real minor securities execution.

### “Then what exactly is real?”

The Solana program, Mandate/AssetRule enforcement, on-chain refusal, version/nonce behavior, Devnet transactions, signed Pyth verification, server-side state/idempotency, request/guardian flow and receipts are real components of the demo.

### “Why not just use a database?”

A database can reproduce much of the interface and authorization logic. The difference is where the rule lives. With KEYS, capital placed under the KEYS program-controlled path is constrained in the same execution path that moves the demo asset. The UI can disappear and the boundary still holds. We do not claim that one-time authorization is impossible in Web2; we use Solana so the authority rule is part of asset execution rather than only a promise made by our application backend.

### “What does KEYS bring to Solana?”

Solana already makes assets programmable and provides delegation primitives. KEYS turns that programmability into a human authority model: not approve every trade, not hand over everything, but agree on standing rules and let the person act. Family is the clearest wedge for that new consumer behavior.

### “How is this different from a native Solana allowance?”

A native allowance delegates spend capacity. A KEYS Key is a standing authority object with asset/action scope, limits and market conditions plus a boundary workflow. The strengthened **deployed** ALLOW_ONCE proof now shows request/mint/Mandate-nonce-bound single use, exact-notional action binding, consumption, non-precedent semantics and replay refusal. Canonical run `36150024852` proves: guardian-approved $12 → altered $11 REFUSE / `AllowanceActionMismatch` → approved $12 ALLOW → standing Key v7 → v7 unchanged → replay REFUSE / `AllowanceAlreadyUsed`.

### “Why does this need Pyth?”

Because a USD limit or a precommitted price condition cannot be enforced correctly from a frontend display price. Pyth provides signed external market truth to the capital path.

### “Can Pyth increase the child’s limit?”

No. Pyth can cause a refusal. Only a guardian-authorized transition can widen standing authority.

### “Does finishing lessons unlock more money?”

No. Learning has `authorityEffect: NONE`. It builds understanding and Practice; authority is a separate human decision.

### “Could the child just edit the limit in the browser?”

No. The current route no longer treats the browser’s Mandate as authority. Evaluation loads current server/on-chain state, and authority-changing routes are guardian-role gated.

### “What prevents double spending from two tabs?”

A Cloudflare Durable Object serializes the family reservation, period spend and balance check around execution. User intents also carry idempotency keys. The hosted smoke now proves this with concurrent AAPL/TSLA-labeled reservations against one shared family budget, then releases the proof reservations without changing spend.

### “How does Allow once work?”

It is not a generic bypass and it does not widen standing authority. The execution must cite the approved request id, match its asset/current Mandate nonce and match the guardian-approved USD notional within unavoidable one-base-unit token rounding. A materially different amount refuses before transfer; after one successful use, the permission is consumed and a replay refuses with `AllowanceAlreadyUsed`. Standing Key version remains unchanged by the one-time exception.

### “Why AAPL?”

AAPL is the current entitled/proven Pyth **Money execution lane**, not the whole market universe. KEYS now proves live Pyth discovery across equities, crypto, FX, metals and commodities, but those additional markets remain Learn/Practice until their representation, eligibility and execution path are independently proven.

### “Are all prices live?”

No. Only fresh entitled Pyth quotes are labeled live. Unavailable symbols stay clearly sample; the backend never converts an unknown price to zero. AAPL history is now fetched server-side from Pyth Pro History for supported periods. Unentitled or unconfigured history still fails closed and the UI keeps its sample fallback clearly labeled.

### “What is PreStocks doing here?”

It demonstrates the representation problem that KEYS has to reason about: underlying company, token representation, holder eligibility and KEYS authority are separate concepts. PreStocks does not automatically make an asset executable.


### “What is Tessera doing here?”

Tessera gives KEYS a real private-market representation example. Its T-Tokens are loan participation rights rather than direct equity, so the product can teach the difference between the underlying company, the token representation, user eligibility and KEYS authority. The integration is live, but execution remains fail-closed and we do not claim real minor securities execution.

### “How would this become a real company?”

The Family product is the first policy pack for a broader Mandate engine: versioned bounded authority for delegated capital. Production rollout would add regulated custody/brokerage partners, identity/KYC, jurisdiction policy, user-bound wallets and broader asset adapters without changing the core authority primitive.

## Recording checklist

Before recording:
- use a fresh browser/profile or reset demo Family state;
- confirm Cloudflare latest build is deployed;
- confirm child session;
- confirm guardian session switch;
- confirm AAPL Pyth evidence is fresh;
- confirm current Mandate is ACTIVE;
- confirm balance/test funding is sufficient;
- confirm in-bounds amount;
- confirm boundary amount;
- rehearse the exact ALLOW_ONCE request, retry and replay-refusal sequence;
- verify Explorer link;
- keep a backup recording of the canonical proof receipt;
- do not expose secrets/dashboard environment values.

## Submission links

- Live demo: `https://cresco-lac.vercel.app`
- Backend health/runtime: `https://keys-api-stocklana.faadil-casecraft.workers.dev`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/Faadil1/keys`
- Pitch video: **TBD**
- Technical video: **TBD**

## Final claim gate

Allowed:
> **KEYS enforces bounded capital actions on Solana using live Pyth market truth.**

Not allowed:
- “KEYS buys real AAPL for minors.”
- “KEYS is a broker/custodian.”
- “All Explore prices are live.”
- “Learning automatically earns more authority.”
- “PreStocks eligibility is inferred from the wallet.”
- “This is mainnet.”


### “Why did you not enter the PreStocks bounty?”

The canonical submitted build integrates Tessera T-Tokens. The official PreStocks bounty explicitly makes projects integrating any non-PreStocks pre-IPO token ineligible, so we do not select that bounty. We keep the PreStocks integration only as an honest secondary representation/Practice surface rather than hiding the incompatibility or gaming eligibility.

### “Why ALLOW_ONCE instead of only widening the Key?”

It demonstrates a stronger authority primitive. A guardian can approve exactly one boundary crossing without permanently expanding standing authority. KEYS binds the permission to the exact request/amount/nonce, consumes it after successful use, and refuses replay with `AllowanceAlreadyUsed`. Standing widening remains supported and is shown in the technical walkthrough.
