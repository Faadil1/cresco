# KEYS

**Financial independence shouldn't happen all at once.**

KEYS Family is a bounded-autonomy experience for young people learning to use tokenized stocks.

A guardian defines an explicit **Mandate**. Inside it, the young person can act freely without asking permission on every action. Outside it, the action is refused or becomes a boundary request. Wider standing authority requires an explicit authorized human transition.

> **Learn in context. Act freely inside bounds. Ask for more freedom only at the boundary.**

## Why this belongs on Solana

**Solana makes financial assets programmable. Cresco / KEYS makes authority over those assets programmable for humans.**

The consumer idea is not "blockchain parental controls." It is a standing authority model:

- inside the Key, the delegate acts without per-action approval;
- at the boundary, the guardian can refuse, allow this request once, or create a wider standing Key;
- a one-time permission can be consumed without rewriting the standing Key;
- market evidence can restrict execution, but it can never grant more human authority.

A conventional backend could reproduce much of the interface. The reason KEYS belongs on Solana is **where the rule is enforced**: for capital placed under the KEYS program-controlled path, the boundary is checked in the same execution path that moves the demo asset. The UI is not the guard.

This also complements Solana's native delegation/allowance primitives rather than pretending they do not exist. A native allowance delegates spend capacity. KEYS adds a human authority grammar around standing rules, boundary events and non-precedent exceptions.

Current deployed ALLOW_ONCE truth: the strengthened canonical Devnet program now proves request/mint/Mandate-nonce-bound single use **and** exact-notional action binding in the capital path. In canonical run `36150024852`, a materially altered $11 action against a guardian-approved $12 request refused with `AllowanceActionMismatch`; the approved $12 action then executed successfully; the standing Mandate stayed v7 → v7 (`standingAuthorityChanged=false`); and replay refused with `AllowanceAlreadyUsed`. The Solana path recomputes the Pyth-derived USD notional and allows only unavoidable one-base-unit token rounding.


## Product primitive

The long-term primitive is a versioned, revocable permission envelope over capital:

- principal / guardian;
- delegate / beneficiary;
- asset scope;
- allowed actions;
- per-action and per-period limits;
- expiry;
- market conditions;
- escalation / revocation;
- version / nonce.

**Stages are Family UX. Mandates are technical truth.**

The familiar `LEARN → PRACTICE → PROPOSE → BOUNDED → INDEPENDENT` progression remains useful as a Family policy pack, but it is not the universal protocol architecture.

## Learning stays

Learning is contextual rather than bureaucratic:

- first use of a new asset/action;
- Practice mode;
- boundary explanations;
- Pyth-driven market-condition changes;
- post-action review.

Learning completion, quizzes, P&L or AI scoring never auto-grant authority.

## v0.2 bounded autonomy — canonical devnet proof PASS

KEYS now proves the core product mechanism on local Solana and the canonical devnet program.

Canonical program:

`ABjE6V5q9VbD3CAHDXxvztY5kXQmDXHRcEP1kZ4KSSfk`

Canonical devnet run:

https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/35959137364

Result:

**12 passing**

The runtime proves:

1. program-controlled demo-token vault;
2. explicit AssetRule / permission boundary;
3. in-bounds action executes without guardian approval;
4. out-of-bounds action refuses inside the Solana program;
5. explicit guardian widening advances version/nonce;
6. stale execution material refuses;
7. the same larger action succeeds after widening;
8. pause/downward authority blocks execution;
9. live signed Pyth Pro/Lazer AAPL evidence is verified inside the Solana capital path;
10. Pyth-derived USD/notional limits are load-bearing;
11. a notional breach refuses;
12. a precommitted max-price condition refuses;
13. Pyth has **no authority-widening effect**.

Canonical Pyth proof feed:

`Equity.US.AAPL/USD` — feed id `922`.

Current AAPL entitlement proof: `https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36035283447`

Current AAPL HTTP→Solana devnet proof: `https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36034651466`

Historical TSLA proofs remain valid evidence of the same mechanism.

## Frozen v0.2 integration contract

The current frontend/backend semantic contract is:

[docs/FRONTEND-BACKEND-CONTRACT-V0.2.md](docs/FRONTEND-BACKEND-CONTRACT-V0.2.md)

Current v0.2 API includes:

- `POST /api/v0.2/auth/demo-session`
- `GET /api/v0.2/family/state`
- `GET /api/v0.2/mandates/current`
- `POST /api/v0.2/mandates/transition`
- `POST /api/v0.2/actions/evaluate`
- `POST /api/v0.2/actions/execute`
- `POST /api/v0.2/boundary-requests`
- `POST /api/v0.2/boundary-requests/:id/decision`
- `POST /api/v0.2/funding/deposits`
- `POST /api/v0.2/learning/progress`
- `GET /api/v0.2/portfolio?mode=money`
- `GET /api/v0.2/market/quotes`
- `GET /api/v0.2/demo/runtime`
- `GET /api/v0.2/demo/maya`

The Family execution bridge uses a server-held Devnet demo signer, live signed Pyth AAPL evidence, a demo SPL token, and Durable Object state/idempotency. Do not interpret it as production wallet/custody/brokerage architecture.

The old v0.1 contract remains historical proof only.

## Multi-market discovery

AAPL remains the canonical Money execution proof, but it is no longer the Explore market boundary.

KEYS now exposes an entitlement-checked Pyth discovery route:

`GET /api/v0.2/market/discovery`

Current live/proven discovery spans US equities, crypto, FX, metals and commodities. Non-AAPL feeds remain Learn/Practice only; Pyth entitlement never grants KEYS authority or Money eligibility.

Proof:
- authenticated discovery: https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36115570744
- hosted non-mutating route: https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36115973480

See [multi-market evidence](evidence/pyth/PYTH-MULTI-MARKET-DISCOVERY-PROOF-2026-09-25.md).

## Sponsor integrations

KEYS currently targets the Stocklana main track plus two sponsor tracks that strengthen the locked product: Pyth and Tessera.

### Pyth — proven

Pyth is load-bearing market truth in the canonical Solana capital path: signed live Pyth Pro/Lazer evidence, on-chain verification, USD/notional enforcement, market-condition refusal, and authority effect `NONE`.

### PreStocks bounty eligibility note

The PreStocks integration remains in KEYS as a fail-closed representation/Practice surface. However, the canonical submitted build also integrates Tessera, and the official PreStocks bounty excludes projects integrating any non-PreStocks pre-IPO token. KEYS therefore does **not** target the PreStocks bounty in the current submission configuration.

### PreStocks — live API integration

KEYS consumes the official PreStocks public token catalog:

`https://prestocks.com/api/prestocks`

Current routes:

- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/prestocks`
- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/prestocks/:symbol`

The adapter exposes the exact Solana representation plus live mark/token pricing for contextual Practice and representation understanding.

It defaults fail-closed:

- `eligibility.status = UNKNOWN`
- `executionEligible = false`
- `practiceAvailable = true`
- `authorityEffect = NONE`

Live proof command:

`npm run proof:prestocks`

### Tessera — live representation integration

KEYS consumes Tessera's public T-Token metadata through:

- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/tessera`
- `GET /api/v0.2/integrations/tessera/:asset`

The integration currently exposes T-OpenAI, T-Kalshi and T-SpaceX as **loan participation rights**, not direct equity. KEYS keeps them Learn/Practice-only by default: `executionEligible=false`, `authorityEffect=NONE`.

Live API proof: https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36112072978  
Hosted Cloudflare proof: https://github.com/Faadil1/keys/actions/runs/36112229684

See [docs/BOUNTY-INTEGRATION-GATE-2026-09-24.md](docs/BOUNTY-INTEGRATION-GATE-2026-09-24.md).


## Truth boundary

The current capital proof uses an explicitly labeled **demo/mock SPL token** with real live Pyth market evidence.

KEYS does **not** currently claim:

- real minor securities execution;
- brokerage or custodial service;
- legal conventional-share ownership from a token balance;
- Solana mainnet deployment;
- universal issuer/venue/jurisdiction eligibility.

The current proof lane establishes live AAPL entitlement and on-chain Pyth-backed execution. Historical TSLA proofs remain valid evidence.

## Consumer frontend — Cresco

The family-facing app is **Cresco**, built in [`apps/web`](apps/web). The hackathon Family flow is now connected to the stateful KEYS v0.2 backend: role-scoped demo sessions, shared Family state, server-owned Mandate evaluation, persistent boundary requests, guardian decisions, durable idempotency/reservations, test funding, learning/portfolio sync, and the proven AAPL Solana Devnet demo-token execution lane.

See [Cresco implementation summary](docs/CRESCO-FRONTEND-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md) and [backend integration handoff](docs/CRESCO-BACKEND-INTEGRATION-HANDOFF.md).

## Collaboration

- Frontend / product experience: **Benita**
- Backend / Solana / Pyth / proof: **Faadil**

Backend v0.2 is now in proof-maintenance/integration-support mode. Benita can integrate against the frozen v0.2 contract.

See [docs/BENITA-FRONTEND-HANDOFF.md](docs/BENITA-FRONTEND-HANDOFF.md).
